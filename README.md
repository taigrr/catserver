# catserver
Go server to serve concatenated files. Helpful for old-fashioned web development.

This project is meant to compile down to one binary which does one thing and does it well, following the Unix philosophy.

The goal is to offer a simpler alternative to one feature offered by GulpJS, Webpack, etc., namely, concatenating files and serving the result.
