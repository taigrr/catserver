# catserver
Go server to serve concatenated files. Helpful for old-fashioned web development.

This project is meant to compile down to one binary which does one thing and does it well, following the Unix philosophy.

The goal is to offer a simpler alternative to one feature offered by GulpJS, Webpack, etc., namely, concatenating files and serving the result.

Please note this project is in rapid-development mode.
Issues are welcome, but may be ignored at first as there is a core set of features which must work first.
Since project development time is expected to be short, documentation will lag behind.
